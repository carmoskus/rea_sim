rea_sim - Simulation analysis of differential expression testing in RNA-Seq data
========================================================

`rea_sim` helps you to:

- simulate RNA-Seq counts from a variety of statistical models (negative binomial, normal, log-normal, multinomial)
- automate running a variety of differential expression analyses using various programs and combinations of covariates (DESeq2, edgeR, voom-limma, etc.)

For an example pipeline to be copied and pasted into the command line, look at [run_cmds.txt](run_cmds.txt)

Subprograms:
- The create scripts
- createNB.R: Simulates data from NB distribution
- createLN.R: Simulates data from LN distribution
