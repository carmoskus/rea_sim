1 - 50/50 averaging of p-values
2 - averaging of p-values based on Wilcoxon test of comparison of KS p-values for GOF to distributions
3 - averaging of p-values directly based on KS p-values
4 - using BMA to average log2FC estimates and then do a Wald test
5 - same as v4, except using the 1-sample KS test results (v3 of checkdist)
